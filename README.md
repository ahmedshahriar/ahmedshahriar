<br/>

I am Ahmed Shahriar Sakib. With a background as a Software Engineer, I specialize in data analytics, machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), web scraping/crawling, and automation.

I completed my MASc at the UWaterloo, where my research focused on ML and NLP, mostly working with large language models (LLMs). I hold a BSc in Software Engineering and have since (2019) been building scalable software systems and applying data-driven technologies to solve real-world problems. 

I’ve earned professional certifications from AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM, and DeepLearning.AI, covering cloud computing, AI/ML, and data science. I am also a Kaggle Notebooks Master. 

I’m currently focused on building ML-powered applications and scalable data systems, and I’m always open to collaborating on impactful Data/ML/NLP software engineering projects.
